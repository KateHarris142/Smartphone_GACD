Each of the subjects took multiple measurements for each activity. Each of the variables in this data show the mean of those measurements for each person for each activity.

key words:
subject   - measurements taken of the motion of the subject
gravity   - measurements from the gravitational force (as opposed to the acceleration due 
            to movement of the subject) 
acc       - measurements from the accelerometer within the phone
gyro      - measurements from the gyroscope within the phone
jerk      - measurement of jerk motion, taken from the body linear acceleration and the 
            angular velocity
            
If prefixed with:
time domain  - the signals are time domain, units: secs
frequency domain - a Fast Fourier transform is applied to the signal to convert the measurement  in a frequency domain signal, units: Hz
angle  - signals are averaged in a signal window sample (of 2.56 secs)

If ending in:
mean - the mean of the signals from each subject for that measurement of the variable
std - the standard deviation of the measurements of each subject for that measurement of the variable
